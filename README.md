# Overview
This analysis shows ride-sharing data for different city types. It's goal is to show the differences between city types, and use that data to inform future business decisions at PyBer.

# Results
<p>The following graph shows the total fares for the first 4 months of 2019 by city type. It clearly shows that the rural rides produce the most fares, and as you get closer to the city, the fares decrease.</p>

<p>Similar to the above graph, the average fare, and average fare per driver also decreases as you move from rural towards urban areas.</p>

# Summary
* Reduce the number of drivers in urban areas by at least 33%. So that the number of rides given per driver is at or above 1. Currently, there are a lot of drivers who don't receive a fare while working.
* Increase the number of drivers in rural areas by up to 60%. So that the number of rides given per driver is closer to 1. Currently, it is at 1.6 which could indicate passengers are waiting longer for a driver.
